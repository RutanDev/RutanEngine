TODO:
* Load in models
* Experiment with NVRHI: https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NVRHI

Setup pipelines
* Graphics
* Compute

* Which shaders are involved
* Which constant buffers is going to be used and on what bindinglocation

Example - terrain
* vertexshader:
* pixelshader: 
* constantbuffer

RenderPass
* Can have multiple shaders
 
For materials
* 1 u32 with bits enabled/disabled if it has textures.
 
Debugging in editor
* See shader code
* Disassemble code to assembly to check stuff - D3DDisassemble

Performance
* Default memory-allocator is bad...
* Avoid vectors as much as possible
